       Report pertaining to occurrence of a cognizable offence, received at the Police Station is called First Information Report, popularly known as FIR.

On receipt of this information police registers the report in a FIR Register and begins the investigation of the crime.

8. What is a Bailable offence?

<p style="color:Black;margin:30px;text-align:justify; width: 626px;">
     In bailable offences, the accused can claim bail as a matter of right. Police is supposed to release such an accused on bail if he is prepared to give bail at any time while he is in the custody of a Police Officer

</p>



 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



 

9. What is a Non-Bailable offence?

<p style="color:Black;margin:30px;text-align:justify; width: 626px;">
      In non-bailable offences, the accused is not entitled to bail as a matter of right. Police invariably does not take bail in such cases and only the Court grants bail. The list of bailable and non-bailable offences is given in the first schedule of the Cr.P.C.

</p>



 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



 

10. Can Police call someone for investigation even if granted anticipatory bail by the court?

<p style="color:Black;margin:30px;text-align:justify; width: 626px;">
     Yes, certainly. The court only forbids the arrest but does not prevent police from calling the accused for investigation. Intact, invariably it is one of the conditions of the anticipatory bail that the accused shall make himself available for investigation as and when required by the investigating officer. Refusal to do so may entitle the investigating officer to move the court for cancellation of anticipatory bail. In case the investigating officer finds that a criminal case is made out against an accused granted anticipatory bail by the court, he will not arrest him but will release him on bail, even if the offence is Non-Bailable.

</p>



 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



 

11. Is it an offence to register/lodge false FIR ?

Private person against whom false FIR/complaint has been lodged can also file complaint in the court for the offence of defamation.
